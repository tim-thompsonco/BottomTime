<h2>Bottom Time API</h2>
<p>This is a .NET Core Web API that I am building both as a means to back up my physical dive log and also to deepen my skill set with .NET. It is designed using the OpenAPI / Swagger v1 specification. This API will allow for CRUD operations pertaining to dives for a particular user.</p>
